This is a self-learning interpretable Chess AI based on a probabilistic model and naive bayes assumptions. The AI plays against itself, and through reinforcement learning, masters the game (in theory :P).

Uses a probabilistic generative model to approximate players and infer the best moves, as well as a tree search with alpha-beta pruning to go through possible moves.

I have derived the formulas behind the player-approximating model here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/cfxvxdgbpkcn
